    "answer": [
      "The fundamental architectural difference between the Vision Transformer (ViT) and traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is that ViT applies a pure Transformer architecture directly to sequences of image patches, without relying on convolutional layers. In contrast, traditional CNNs use convolutional layers to process images, often in conjunction with self-attention mechanisms. The ViT architecture interprets an image as a sequence of patches and processes it using a standard Transformer encoder, similar to those used in natural language processing tasks. This approach eliminates the need for convolutional layers and allows the model to learn representations of images using self-attention mechanisms alone. \n\nIn traditional CNNs, convolutional layers are used to extract local features from images, whereas in ViT, the Transformer architecture is used to model global relationships between image patches. This difference in architecture allows ViT to achieve excellent results on image classification tasks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train compared to state-of-the-art CNNs. \n\nIt's worth noting that the provided context does not include specific tables or charts to support this comparison. However, the text clearly outlines the architectural differences between ViT and traditional CNNs, highlighting the potential benefits of using a pure Transformer architecture for image recognition tasks.",
      "The Vision Transformer (ViT) processes a 2D image into an input suitable for the Transformer encoder by reshaping the image into a sequence of flattened 2D patches. This is done by dividing the image into patches of size (P, P), where P is the patch size, and then flattening each patch into a 1D vector. The resulting sequence of patch embeddings is then fed into the Transformer encoder.\n\nSpecifically, the image x ∈ R^(H×W×C) is reshaped into a sequence of patches xp ∈ R^(N×(P^2×C)), where N = HW/P^2 is the number of patches, and P is the patch size. The patches are then flattened and mapped to a constant latent vector size D using a trainable linear projection (Eq. 1). The output of this projection is referred to as the patch embeddings.\n\nThe patch embeddings are then prepended with a learnable embedding, similar to the [class] token in BERT, to serve as the input to the Transformer encoder. Position embeddings are also added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information.\n\nThis process allows the ViT to interpret an image as a sequence of patches and process it using a standard Transformer encoder, similar to those used in natural language processing tasks. The use of patch embeddings and position embeddings enables the ViT to capture spatial relationships between patches and learn effective representations of images.\n\nIt's worth noting that the provided context does not include specific tables or charts that directly support this explanation. However, the text clearly outlines the process of reshaping an image into a sequence of patch embeddings and feeding it into the Transformer encoder.",
      "The specific inductive biases present in CNNs but lacking in the Vision Transformer are:\n\n1. **Locality**: CNNs have locality built into each layer, meaning that they are designed to capture local patterns and features in the input data. In contrast, the Vision Transformer only has locality in its MLP layers, while its self-attention layers are global.\n2. **Two-dimensional neighborhood structure**: CNNs are designed to capture the spatial relationships between neighboring pixels in an image, which is not the case in the Vision Transformer. The Vision Transformer only uses the two-dimensional neighborhood structure when cutting the image into patches and at fine-tuning time for adjusting the position embeddings.\n3. **Translation equivariance**: CNNs are designed to be translationally equivariant, meaning that they are invariant to the location of features in the input data. The Vision Transformer only has translation equivariance in its MLP layers, while its self-attention layers are not translationally equivariant.\n\nThese inductive biases are \"baked into\" each layer of a CNN, meaning that they are inherent to the architecture and are present throughout the entire model. In contrast, the Vision Transformer has much less image-specific inductive bias, and instead relies on learning spatial relationships and patterns from scratch through its self-attention layers.",

        "3 METHOD\n\nIn model design we follow the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as closely as possible. An advantage of this intentionally simple setup is that scalable NLP Transformer architectures – and their efﬁcient implementations – can be used almost out of the box.\n\n3.1 VISION TRANSFORMER (VIT)\n\nAn overview of the model is depicted in Figure 1. The standard Transformer receives as input a 1D sequence of token embeddings. To handle 2D images, we reshape the image x ∈ RH×W×C into a sequence of ﬂattened 2D patches xp ∈ RN×(P 2·C), where (H,W) is the resolution of the original image, C is the number of channels, (P,P) is the resolution of each image patch, and N = HW/P 2 is the resulting number of patches, which also serves as the effective input sequence length for the Transformer. The Transformer uses constant latent vector size D through all of its layers, so we ﬂatten the patches and map to D dimensions with a trainable linear projection (Eq. 1). We refer to the output of this projection as the patch embeddings.\n\nSimilar to BERT’s [class] token, we prepend a learnable embedding to the sequence of embed- ded patches (z0 0 = xclass), whose state at the output of the Transformer encoder (z0 L) serves as the image representation y (Eq. 4). Both during pre-training and ﬁne-tuning, a classiﬁcation head is at- tached to z0 L. The classiﬁcation head is implemented by a MLP with one hidden layer at pre-training time and by a single linear layer at ﬁne-tuning time.\n\nPosition embeddings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information. We use standard learnable 1D position embeddings, since we have not observed signiﬁcant performance gains from using more advanced 2D-aware position embeddings (Appendix D.4). The resulting sequence of embedding vectors serves as input to the encoder.\n\nThe Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017) consists of alternating layers of multiheaded self- attention (MSA, see Appendix A) and MLP blocks (Eq. 2, 3). Layernorm (LN) is applied before every block, and residual connections after every block (Wang et al., 2019; Baevski & Auli, 2019).\n\n3\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n\nThe MLP contains two layers with a GELU non-linearity.\n\n20 = (Xess) XE: 9@E;---; xNE)+E,,., Ee R Ox?

        "5 CONCLUSION\n\nWe have explored the direct application of Transformers to image recognition. Unlike prior works using self-attention in computer vision, we do not introduce image-speciﬁc inductive biases into the architecture apart from the initial patch extraction step. Instead, we interpret an image as a sequence of patches and process it by a standard Transformer encoder as used in NLP. This simple, yet scalable, strategy works surprisingly well when coupled with pre-training on large datasets. Thus, Vision Transformer matches or exceeds the state of the art on many image classiﬁcation datasets, whilst being relatively cheap to pre-train.\n\nWhile these initial results are encouraging, many challenges remain. One is to apply ViT to other computer vision tasks, such as detection and segmentation. Our results, coupled with those in Carion et al. (2020), indicate the promise of this approach. Another challenge is to continue exploring self- supervised pre-training methods. Our initial experiments show improvement from self-supervised pre-training, but there is still large gap between self-supervised and large-scale supervised pre- training. Finally, further scaling of ViT would likely lead to improved performance.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe work was performed in Berlin, Z¨urich, and Amsterdam.

        "Inductive bias. We note that Vision Transformer has much less image-speciﬁc inductive bias than CNNs. In CNNs, locality, two-dimensional neighborhood structure, and translation equivariance are baked into each layer throughout the whole model. In ViT, only MLP layers are local and transla- tionally equivariant, while the self-attention layers are global. The two-dimensional neighborhood structure is used very sparingly: in the beginning of the model by cutting the image into patches and at ﬁne-tuning time for adjusting the position embeddings for images of different resolution (as de- scribed below). Other than that, the position embeddings at initialization time carry no information about the 2D positions of the patches and all spatial relations between the patches have to be learned from scratch.\n\nHybrid Architecture. As an alternative to raw image patches, the input sequence can be formed from feature maps of a CNN (LeCun et al., 1989). In this hybrid model, the patch embedding projection E (Eq. 1) is applied to patches extracted from a CNN feature map. As a special case, the patches can have spatial size 1x1, which means that the input sequence is obtained by simply ﬂattening the spatial dimensions of the feature map and projecting to the Transformer dimension. The classiﬁcation input embedding and position embeddings are added as described above.\n\n3.2 FINE-TUNING AND HIGHER RESOLUTION\n\nTypically, we pre-train ViT on large datasets, and ﬁne-tune to (smaller) downstream tasks. For this, we remove the pre-trained prediction head and attach a zero-initialized D × K feedforward layer, where K is the number of downstream classes. It is often beneﬁcial to ﬁne-tune at higher resolution than pre-training (Touvron et al., 2019; Kolesnikov et al., 2020). When feeding images of higher resolution, we keep the patch size the same, which results in a larger effective sequence length. The Vision Transformer can handle arbitrary sequence lengths (up to memory constraints), however, the pre-trained position embeddings may no longer be meaningful. We therefore perform 2D interpolation of the pre-trained position embeddings, according to their location in the original image. Note that this resolution adjustment and patch extraction are the only points at which an inductive bias about the 2D structure of the images is manually injected into the Vision Transformer."

Hybrids improve upon pure Transformers for smaller model sizes, but the gap vanishes for larger models.\n\nregion spanned by BiT models of different sizes. The BiT CNNs outperform ViT on ImageNet, but with the larger datasets, ViT overtakes.\n\nSecond, we train our models on random subsets of 9M, 30M, and 90M as well as the full JFT- 300M dataset. We do not perform additional regularization on the smaller subsets and use the same hyper-parameters for all settings. This way, we assess the intrinsic model properties, and not the effect of regularization. We do, however, use early-stopping, and report the best validation accuracy achieved during training. To save compute, we report few-shot linear accuracy instead of full ﬁne- tuning accuracy. Figure 4 contains the results. Vision Transformers overﬁt more than ResNets with comparable computational cost on smaller datasets. For example, ViT-B/32 is slightly faster than ResNet50; it performs much worse on the 9M subset, but better on 90M+ subsets. The same is true for ResNet152x2 and ViT-L/16. This result reinforces the intuition that the convolutional inductive bias is useful for smaller datasets, but for larger ones, learning the relevant patterns directly from data is sufﬁcient, even beneﬁcial.\n\nOverall, the few-shot results on ImageNet (Figure 4), as well as the low-data results on VTAB (Table 2) seem promising for very low-data transfer. Further analysis of few-shot properties of ViT is an exciting direction of future work.\n\n7\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021",

With fewer inductive biases for vision than ResNets, how crucial is the dataset size? We perform two series of experiments.\n\nFirst, we pre-train ViT models on datasets of increasing size: ImageNet, ImageNet-21k, and JFT- 300M. To boost the performance on the smaller datasets, we optimize three basic regularization parameters – weight decay, dropout, and label smoothing. Figure 3 shows the results after ﬁne- tuning to ImageNet (results on other datasets are shown in Table 5)2. When pre-trained on the smallest dataset, ImageNet, ViT-Large models underperform compared to ViT-Base models, despite (moderate) regularization. With ImageNet-21k pre-training, their performances are similar. Only with JFT-300M, do we see the full beneﬁt of larger models. Figure 3 also shows the performance\n\n2Note that the ImageNet pre-trained models are also ﬁne-tuned, but again on ImageNet. This is because the resolution increase during ﬁne-tuning improves the performance.\n\n6\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n\n90 > g @; > - 8 e 3 5 3 < 80 @ ° = Ey pe o 16 3 oe Z 75 BiT © ViT-L2 3 e bb ° e ViT-B/32 © ViT-L/16 & \"0 @ > ViT-B/6 =@ ViT-H/I4 ImageNet ImageNet-21k JFT-300M Pre-training dataset\n\ns 3 e & ba 3 60 Z So g R=} 50 3 wy 4 % 40 _ ra = = = 5 -©-ViT-L/16 -® ViT-B/32 --ResNet50x1 (BiT) 2 30 ~©-ViT-L/32_-®-ViT-b/32_ -@ ResNet152x2 (BiT) 4 10M 30M 100 M 300 M Number of JFT pre-training samples\n\nFigure 3: Transfer to ImageNet.

        "4.4 SCALING STUDY\n\nWe perform a controlled scaling study of different models by evaluating transfer performance from JFT-300M. In this setting data size does not bottleneck the models’ performances, and we assess performance versus pre-training cost of each model. The model set includes: 7 ResNets, R50x1, R50x2 R101x1, R152x1, R152x2, pre-trained for 7 epochs, plus R152x2 and R200x3 pre-trained for 14 epochs; 6 Vision Transformers, ViT-B/32, B/16, L/32, L/16, pre-trained for 7 epochs, plus L/16 and H/14 pre-trained for 14 epochs; and 5 hybrids, R50+ViT-B/32, B/16, L/32, L/16 pre- trained for 7 epochs, plus R50+ViT-L/16 pre-trained for 14 epochs (for hybrids, the number at the end of the model name stands not for the patch size, but for the total dowsampling ratio in the ResNet backbone).\n\nFigure 5 contains the transfer performance versus total pre-training compute (see Appendix D.5 for details on computational costs). Detailed results per model are provided in Table 6 in the Ap- pendix. A few patterns can be observed. First, Vision Transformers dominate ResNets on the performance/compute trade-off. ViT uses approximately 2 − 4× less compute to attain the same performance (average over 5 datasets). Second, hybrids slightly outperform ViT at small compu- tational budgets, but the difference vanishes for larger models. This result is somewhat surprising, since one might expect convolutional local feature processing to assist ViT at any size. Third, Vision Transformers appear not to saturate within the range tried, motivating future scaling efforts.\n\nINSPECTING VISION TRANSFORMER\n\nTo begin to understand how the Vision Transformer processes im- age data, we analyze its internal representations. The ﬁrst layer of the Vision Transformer linearly projects the ﬂattened patches into a lower-dimensional space (Eq. 1). Figure 7 (left) shows the top prin- cipal components of the the learned embedding ﬁlters. The com- ponents resemble plausible basis functions for a low-dimensional representation of the ﬁne structure within each patch.\n\nInput Attention\n\n= %\n\nAfter the projection, a learned position embedding is added to the patch representations. Figure 7 (center) shows that the model learns to encode distance within the image in the similarity of position em- beddings, i.e. closer patches tend to have more similar position em- beddings. Further, the row-column structure appears; patches in the same row/column have similar embeddings. Finally, a sinusoidal structure is sometimes apparent for larger grids (Appendix D). That the position embeddings learn to represent 2D image topology ex- plains why hand-crafted 2D-aware embedding variants do not yield improvements (Appendix D.4)."

This is because in Axial-ViT models, each Transformer block with global self-attention is replaced by two Axial Transformer blocks, one with row and one with column self- attention and although the sequence length that self-attention operates on is smaller in axial case, there is a extra MLP per Axial-ViT block. For the AxialResNet, although it looks reasonable in terms of accuracy/compute trade-off (Figure 13, left), the naive implementation is extremely slow on TPUs (Figure 13, right).\n\nD.7 ATTENTION DISTANCE\n\nTo understand how ViT uses self-attention to integrate information across the image, we analyzed the average distance spanned by attention weights at different layers (Figure 11). This “attention distance” is analogous to receptive ﬁeld size in CNNs. Average attention distance is highly variable across heads in lower layers, with some heads attending to much of the image, while others attend to small regions at or near the query location. As depth increases, attention distance increases for all heads. In the second half of the network, most heads attend widely across tokens.\n\nD.8 ATTENTION MAPS\n\nTo compute maps of the attention from the output token to the input space (Figures 6 and 14), we used Attention Rollout (Abnar & Zuidema, 2020). Brieﬂy, we averaged attention weights of ViT- L/16 across all heads and then recursively multiplied the weight matrices of all layers. This accounts for the mixing of attention across tokens through all layers.\n\nD.9 OBJECTNET RESULTS\n\nWe also evaluate our ﬂagship ViT-H/14 model on the ObjectNet benchmark following the evaluation setup in Kolesnikov et al. (2020), resulting in 82.1% top-5 accuracy and 61.7% top-1 accuracy.",

        "D.2 TRANSFORMER SHAPE\n\nWe ran ablations on scaling different dimensions of the Transformer architecture to ﬁnd out which are best suited for scaling to very large models. Figure 8 shows 5-shot performance on ImageNet for different conﬁgurations. All conﬁgurations are based on a ViT model with 8 layers, D = 1024, DMLP = 2048 and a patch size of 32, the intersection of all lines. We can see that scaling the depth results in the biggest improvements which are clearly visible up until 64 layers. However, diminishing returns are already visible after 16 layers. Interestingly, scaling the width of the net- work seems to result in the smallest changes. Decreasing the patch size and thus increasing the effective sequence length shows surprisingly robust improvements without introducing parameters. These ﬁndings suggest that compute might be a better predictor of performance than the number of parameters, and that scaling should emphasize depth over width if any. Overall, we ﬁnd that scaling all dimensions proportionally results in robust improvements.\n\nD.3 HEAD TYPE AND CLASS TOKEN\n\nIn order to stay as close as possible to the original Transformer model, we made use of an additional [class] token, which is taken as image representation. The output of this token is then trans- formed into a class prediction via a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with tanh as non-linearity in the single hidden layer.\n\nThis design is inherited from the Transformer model for text, and we use it throughout the main paper. An initial attempt at using only image-patch embeddings, globally average-pooling (GAP) them, followed by a linear classiﬁer—just like ResNet’s ﬁnal feature map—performed very poorly. However, we found that this is neither due to the extra token, nor to the GAP operation. Instead,\n\n16\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n\n2 8 —— CLS-Token, Ir=8e-4 —— GAP, Ir=8e-4 — GAP, Ir=3e-4 wn a wo k ko w a & & 8 we 3 ImageNet linear 5-shot accuracy [%] i. a ° Epochs of training\n\nFigure 9: Comparison of class-token and global average pooling classiﬁers.

        "3 METHOD\n\nIn model design we follow the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as closely as possible. An advantage of this intentionally simple setup is that scalable NLP Transformer architectures – and their efﬁcient implementations – can be used almost out of the box.\n\n3.1 VISION TRANSFORMER (VIT)\n\nAn overview of the model is depicted in Figure 1. The standard Transformer receives as input a 1D sequence of token embeddings. To handle 2D images, we reshape the image x ∈ RH×W×C into a sequence of ﬂattened 2D patches xp ∈ RN×(P 2·C), where (H,W) is the resolution of the original image, C is the number of channels, (P,P) is the resolution of each image patch, and N = HW/P 2 is the resulting number of patches, which also serves as the effective input sequence length for the Transformer. The Transformer uses constant latent vector size D through all of its layers, so we ﬂatten the patches and map to D dimensions with a trainable linear projection (Eq. 1). We refer to the output of this projection as the patch embeddings.\n\nSimilar to BERT’s [class] token, we prepend a learnable embedding to the sequence of embed- ded patches (z0 0 = xclass), whose state at the output of the Transformer encoder (z0 L) serves as the image representation y (Eq. 4). Both during pre-training and ﬁne-tuning, a classiﬁcation head is at- tached to z0 L. The classiﬁcation head is implemented by a MLP with one hidden layer at pre-training time and by a single linear layer at ﬁne-tuning time.\n\nPosition embeddings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information. We use standard learnable 1D position embeddings, since we have not observed signiﬁcant performance gains from using more advanced 2D-aware position embeddings (Appendix D.4). The resulting sequence of embedding vectors serves as input to the encoder.\n\nThe Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017) consists of alternating layers of multiheaded self- attention (MSA, see Appendix A) and MLP blocks (Eq. 2, 3). Layernorm (LN) is applied before every block, and residual connections after every block (Wang et al., 2019; Baevski & Auli, 2019).\n\n3\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n\nThe MLP contains two layers with a GELU non-linearity.\n\n20 = (Xess) XE: 9@E;---; xNE)+E,,., Ee R Ox?

        "Self-attention allows ViT to integrate information across the entire Figure 6: Representative ex- image even in the lowest layers. We investigate to what degree amples of attention from the the network makes use of this capability. Speciﬁcally, we compute output token to the input the average distance in image space across which information is space. See Appendix D.7 for integrated, based on the attention weights (Figure 7, right). This details. “attention distance” is analogous to receptive ﬁeld size in CNNs.\n\nWe ﬁnd that some heads attend to most of the image already in the lowest layers, showing that the ability to integrate information globally is indeed used by the model. Other attention heads have consistently small attention distances in the low layers. This highly localized attention is less pronounced in hybrid models that apply a ResNet before the Transformer (Figure 7, right), suggesting that it may serve a similar function as early convolutional layers in CNNs. Further, the attention distance increases with network depth. Globally, we ﬁnd that the model attends to image regions that are semantically relevant for classiﬁcation (Figure 6).\n\n4.6 SELF-SUPERVISION\n\nTransformers show impressive performance on NLP tasks. However, much of their success stems not only from their excellent scalability but also from large scale self-supervised pre-training (Devlin\n\n8\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n\nRGB embedding filters (first 28 principal components)\n\nPosition embedding similarity\n\nVIT-L/16\n\nwows\n\nCosine similarity\n\nMean attention distance (pixels)\n\n88 88\n\n2 8\n\n2 s\n\niS é\n\n8\n\n°\n\n;[ltltonseget™\n\n°\n\nHead1\n\n©\n\nHead2\n\n©\n\nHead3\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nInput patch column\n\nNetwork depth (layer)\n\nFigure 7: Left: Filters of the initial linear embedding of RGB values of ViT-L/32.

We also perform a preliminary exploration on masked patch prediction for self-supervision, mimicking the masked language modeling task used in BERT. With self-supervised pre-training, our smaller ViT-B/16 model achieves 79.9% accuracy on ImageNet, a signiﬁcant improvement of 2% to training from scratch, but still 4% behind supervised pre-training. Appendix B.1.2 contains further details. We leave exploration of contrastive pre-training (Chen et al., 2020b; He et al., 2020; Bachman et al., 2019; H´enaff et al., 2020) to future work."

The BiT CNNs outperform ViT on ImageNet, but with the larger datasets, ViT overtakes.\n\nSecond, we train our models on random subsets of 9M, 30M, and 90M as well as the full JFT- 300M dataset. We do not perform additional regularization on the smaller subsets and use the same hyper-parameters for all settings. This way, we assess the intrinsic model properties, and not the effect of regularization. We do, however, use early-stopping, and report the best validation accuracy achieved during training. To save compute, we report few-shot linear accuracy instead of full ﬁne- tuning accuracy. Figure 4 contains the results. Vision Transformers overﬁt more than ResNets with comparable computational cost on smaller datasets. For example, ViT-B/32 is slightly faster than ResNet50; it performs much worse on the 9M subset, but better on 90M+ subsets. The same is true for ResNet152x2 and ViT-L/16. This result reinforces the intuition that the convolutional inductive bias is useful for smaller datasets, but for larger ones, learning the relevant patterns directly from data is sufﬁcient, even beneﬁcial.\n\nOverall, the few-shot results on ImageNet (Figure 4), as well as the low-data results on VTAB (Table 2) seem promising for very low-data transfer. Further analysis of few-shot properties of ViT is an exciting direction of future work.\n\n7\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021",
        "4 EXPERIMENTS\n\nWe evaluate the representation learning capabilities of ResNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), and the hybrid. To understand the data requirements of each model, we pre-train on datasets of varying size and evaluate many benchmark tasks. When considering the computational cost of pre-training the model, ViT performs very favourably, attaining state of the art on most recognition benchmarks at a lower pre-training cost. Lastly, we perform a small experiment using self-supervision, and show that self-supervised ViT holds promise for the future.\n\n4.1 SETUP\n\nDatasets. To explore model scalability, we use the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset with 1k classes and 1.3M images (we refer to it as ImageNet in what follows), its superset ImageNet-21k with 21k classes and 14M images (Deng et al., 2009), and JFT (Sun et al., 2017) with 18k classes and 303M high-resolution images. We de-duplicate the pre-training datasets w.r.t. the test sets of the downstream tasks following Kolesnikov et al. (2020). We transfer the models trained on these dataset to several benchmark tasks: ImageNet on the original validation labels and the cleaned-up ReaL labels (Beyer et al., 2020), CIFAR-10/100 (Krizhevsky, 2009), Oxford-IIIT Pets (Parkhi et al., 2012), and Oxford Flowers-102 (Nilsback & Zisserman, 2008). For these datasets, pre-processing follows Kolesnikov et al.

We base ViT conﬁgurations on those used for BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), as summarized in Table 1. The “Base” and “Large” models are directly adopted from BERT and we add the larger “Huge” model. In what follows we use brief notation to indicate the model size and the input patch size: for instance, ViT-L/16 means the “Large” variant with 16×16 input patch size. Note that the Transformer’s sequence length is inversely proportional to the square of the patch size, thus models with smaller patch size are computationally more expensive.",
        "4 EXPERIMENTS\n\nWe evaluate the representation learning capabilities of ResNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), and the hybrid. To understand the data requirements of each model, we pre-train on datasets of varying size and evaluate many benchmark tasks. When considering the computational cost of pre-training the model, ViT performs very favourably, attaining state of the art on most recognition benchmarks at a lower pre-training cost. Lastly, we perform a small experiment using self-supervision, and show that self-supervised ViT holds promise for the future."

        "the difference in performance is fully explained by the requirement for a different learning-rate, see Figure 9.\n\nD.4 POSITIONAL EMBEDDING\n\nWe ran ablations on different ways of encoding spatial information using positional embedding. We tried the following cases:\n\n• Providing no positional information: Considering the inputs as a bag of patches.\n\n• 1-dimensional positional embedding: Considering the inputs as a sequence of patches in the raster order (default across all other experiments in this paper).\n\n• 2-dimensional positional embedding: Considering the inputs as a grid of patches in two dimensions. In this case, two sets of embeddings are learned, each for one of the axes, X-embedding, and Y -embedding, each with size D/2. Then, based on the coordinate on the path in the input, we concatenate the X and Y embedding to get the ﬁnal positional embedding for that patch.\n\n• Relative positional embeddings: Considering the relative distance between patches to en- code the spatial information as instead of their absolute position. To do so, we use 1- dimensional Relative Attention, in which we deﬁne the relative distance all possible pairs of patches. Thus, for every given pair (one as query, and the other as key/value in the at- tention mechanism), we have an offset pq − pk, where each offset is associated with an embedding. Then, we simply run extra attention, where we use the original query (the content of query), but use relative positional embeddings as keys. We then use the log- its from the relative attention as a bias term and add it to the logits of the main attention (content-based attention) before applying the softmax.\n\nIn addition to different ways of encoding spatial information, we also tried different ways of in- corporating this information in our model. For the 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional positional embeddings, we tried three different cases: (1) add positional embeddings to the inputs right after\n\n17\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n\n| | | 2 3H a vil ua | tt |\n\na\n\n5 | fom\n\nfom\n\n2 ey a\n\n1a 2H 3H a | | 2a | at\n\n5 | ea\n\nfom Fr\n\n2 ey\n\n5\n\nEy ca\n\nEa 10\n\n2 rey\n\ntT 7 3H a | | | te | “ERR\n\nInput patch column\n\nInput patch column\n\nInput patch column\n\nFigure 10: Position embeddings of models trained with different hyperparameters.\n\nthe stem of them model and before feeding the inputs to the Transformer encoder (default across all other experiments in this paper); (2) learn and add positional embeddings to the inputs at the beginning of each layer; (3) add a learned positional embeddings to the inputs at the beginning of each layer (shared between layers).",
        "3 METHOD\n\nIn model design we follow the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as closely as possible. An advantage of this intentionally simple setup is that scalable NLP Transformer architectures – and their efﬁcient implementations – can be used almost out of the box.\n\n3.1 VISION TRANSFORMER (VIT)\n\nAn overview of the model is depicted in Figure 1. The standard Transformer receives as input a 1D sequence of token embeddings. To handle 2D images, we reshape the image x ∈ RH×W×C into a sequence of ﬂattened 2D patches xp ∈ RN×(P 2·C), where (H,W) is the resolution of the original image, C is the number of channels, (P,P) is the resolution of each image patch, and N = HW/P 2 is the resulting number of patches, which also serves as the effective input sequence length for the Transformer. The Transformer uses constant latent vector size D through all of its layers, so we ﬂatten the patches and map to D dimensions with a trainable linear projection (Eq. 1). We refer to the output of this projection as the patch embeddings.\n\nSimilar to BERT’s [class] token, we prepend a learnable embedding to the sequence of embed- ded patches (z0 0 = xclass), whose state at the output of the Transformer encoder (z0 L) serves as the image representation y (Eq. 4). Both during pre-training and ﬁne-tuning, a classiﬁcation head is at- tached to z0 L. The classiﬁcation head is implemented by a MLP with one hidden layer at pre-training time and by a single linear layer at ﬁne-tuning time.\n\nPosition embeddings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information. We use standard learnable 1D position embeddings, since we have not observed signiﬁcant performance gains from using more advanced 2D-aware position embeddings (Appendix D.4). The resulting sequence of embedding vectors serves as input to the encoder.\n\nThe Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017) consists of alternating layers of multiheaded self- attention (MSA, see Appendix A) and MLP blocks (Eq. 2, 3). Layernorm (LN) is applied before every block, and residual connections after every block (Wang et al., 2019; Baevski & Auli, 2019).\n\n3\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n\nThe MLP contains two layers with a GELU non-linearity.\n\n20 = (Xess) XE: 9@E;---; xNE)+E,,., Ee R Ox?

        "Inductive bias. We note that Vision Transformer has much less image-speciﬁc inductive bias than CNNs. In CNNs, locality, two-dimensional neighborhood structure, and translation equivariance are baked into each layer throughout the whole model. In ViT, only MLP layers are local and transla- tionally equivariant, while the self-attention layers are global. The two-dimensional neighborhood structure is used very sparingly: in the beginning of the model by cutting the image into patches and at ﬁne-tuning time for adjusting the position embeddings for images of different resolution (as de- scribed below). Other than that, the position embeddings at initialization time carry no information about the 2D positions of the patches and all spatial relations between the patches have to be learned from scratch.\n\nHybrid Architecture. As an alternative to raw image patches, the input sequence can be formed from feature maps of a CNN (LeCun et al., 1989). In this hybrid model, the patch embedding projection E (Eq. 1) is applied to patches extracted from a CNN feature map. As a special case, the patches can have spatial size 1x1, which means that the input sequence is obtained by simply ﬂattening the spatial dimensions of the feature map and projecting to the Transformer dimension. The classiﬁcation input embedding and position embeddings are added as described above.\n\n3.2 FINE-TUNING AND HIGHER RESOLUTION\n\nTypically, we pre-train ViT on large datasets, and ﬁne-tune to (smaller) downstream tasks. For this, we remove the pre-trained prediction head and attach a zero-initialized D × K feedforward layer, where K is the number of downstream classes. It is often beneﬁcial to ﬁne-tune at higher resolution than pre-training (Touvron et al., 2019; Kolesnikov et al., 2020). When feeding images of higher resolution, we keep the patch size the same, which results in a larger effective sequence length. The Vision Transformer can handle arbitrary sequence lengths (up to memory constraints), however, the pre-trained position embeddings may no longer be meaningful. We therefore perform 2D interpolation of the pre-trained position embeddings, according to their location in the original image. Note that this resolution adjustment and patch extraction are the only points at which an inductive bias about the 2D structure of the images is manually injected into the Vision Transformer."

(2020), since we pre-train only for 7 epochs, not 30.",
        "D.2 TRANSFORMER SHAPE\n\nWe ran ablations on scaling different dimensions of the Transformer architecture to ﬁnd out which are best suited for scaling to very large models. Figure 8 shows 5-shot performance on ImageNet for different conﬁgurations. All conﬁgurations are based on a ViT model with 8 layers, D = 1024, DMLP = 2048 and a patch size of 32, the intersection of all lines. We can see that scaling the depth results in the biggest improvements which are clearly visible up until 64 layers. However, diminishing returns are already visible after 16 layers. Interestingly, scaling the width of the net- work seems to result in the smallest changes. Decreasing the patch size and thus increasing the effective sequence length shows surprisingly robust improvements without introducing parameters. These ﬁndings suggest that compute might be a better predictor of performance than the number of parameters, and that scaling should emphasize depth over width if any. Overall, we ﬁnd that scaling all dimensions proportionally results in robust improvements.\n\nD.3 HEAD TYPE AND CLASS TOKEN\n\nIn order to stay as close as possible to the original Transformer model, we made use of an additional [class] token, which is taken as image representation. The output of this token is then trans- formed into a class prediction via a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with tanh as non-linearity in the single hidden layer.\n\nThis design is inherited from the Transformer model for text, and we use it throughout the main paper. An initial attempt at using only image-patch embeddings, globally average-pooling (GAP) them, followed by a linear classiﬁer—just like ResNet’s ﬁnal feature map—performed very poorly. However, we found that this is neither due to the extra token, nor to the GAP operation.

To boost the performance on the smaller datasets, we optimize three basic regularization parameters – weight decay, dropout, and label smoothing. Figure 3 shows the results after ﬁne- tuning to ImageNet (results on other datasets are shown in Table 5)2. When pre-trained on the smallest dataset, ImageNet, ViT-Large models underperform compared to ViT-Base models, despite (moderate) regularization. With ImageNet-21k pre-training, their performances are similar. Only with JFT-300M, do we see the full beneﬁt of larger models. Figure 3 also shows the performance\n\n2Note that the ImageNet pre-trained models are also ﬁne-tuned, but again on ImageNet.

To understand the data requirements of each model, we pre-train on datasets of varying size and evaluate many benchmark tasks. When considering the computational cost of pre-training the model, ViT performs very favourably, attaining state of the art on most recognition benchmarks at a lower pre-training cost. Lastly, we perform a small experiment using self-supervision, and show that self-supervised ViT holds promise for the future.\n\n4.1 SETUP\n\nDatasets.

We de-duplicate the pre-training datasets w.r.t. the test sets of the downstream tasks following Kolesnikov et al. (2020). We transfer the models trained on these dataset to several benchmark tasks: ImageNet on the original validation labels and the cleaned-up ReaL labels (Beyer et al., 2020), CIFAR-10/100 (Krizhevsky, 2009), Oxford-IIIT Pets (Parkhi et al., 2012), and Oxford Flowers-102 (Nilsback & Zisserman, 2008).

Note that the Transformer’s sequence length is inversely proportional to the square of the patch size, thus models with smaller patch size are computationally more expensive."

      "ViT is a pure Transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches, reducing reliance on CNNs which use convolution layers with baked-in inductive biases.",
      "The image is split into fixed-size patches which are flattened and linearly projected into embeddings, then position embeddings are added before feeding the sequence to the encoder.",
      "The Vision Transformer lacks image-specific inductive biases such as translation equivariance and locality (except in MLP layers), which are inherent to CNNs throughout the whole model.",
      "ViT yields modest accuracies below ResNets on mid-sized datasets like ImageNet, but outperforms ResNets when trained on larger datasets (14M-300M images), showing that large scale training trumps inductive bias.",
      "The best model, ViT-H/14, achieved an accuracy of 88.55% on ImageNet.",
      "Similar to BERT, a learnable [class] token is prepended to the sequence of embedded patches, and its state at the output of the Transformer encoder serves as the image representation used for classification.",
      "ViT requires substantially fewer computational resources; for instance, ViT-L/16 took 0.68k TPUv3-core-days to pre-train on JFT-300M, while BiT-L took 9.9k.",
      "The authors observed no significant performance gains from using advanced 2D-aware position embeddings compared to standard learnable 1D position embeddings.",
      "In the hybrid architecture, the input sequence to the Transformer is formed from patches extracted from the feature maps of a CNN, rather than raw image patches.",
      "With self-supervised pre-training, the ViT-B/16 model achieved 79.9% accuracy on ImageNet, which is a significant improvement over training from scratch but still behind supervised pre-training."
